# ðŸ§  Adult Income Classification Using Machine Learning

This project is focused on building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50K, based on demographic and employment-related attributes from the **Adult Census Income Dataset**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- âœ… 91.39% Accuracy Achieved using **Gradient Boosting**
- âœ… Compared 4 algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- âœ… Used **Optuna** for hyperparameter optimization
- âœ… Applied **SMOTE** for class balancing
- âœ… Performed detailed **data cleaning**, **encoding**, and **scaling**
- âœ… Real-world dataset: Adult Census Income Dataset (large, noisy & imbalanced)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Info

- **Source**: Kaggle (UCI Adult Dataset based, Pakistan-based version)
- **Target Column**: `income` (<=50K or >50K)
